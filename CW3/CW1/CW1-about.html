Our curriculum is based on international standards and is taught entirely in English. We encourage undergraduate students to join research groups from their first year, with approximately 82% of our undergraduate students joining research groups by their third year and 100% by their final year. To broaden our students' international perspectives, we provide them various overseas study opportunities, including at world-renowned universities such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, City University of Hong Kong, and Peking University.
