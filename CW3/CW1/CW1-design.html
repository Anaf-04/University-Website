        (3) In all pages I have linked HTML to CSS using external links <span>( This Format: &lt;link rel="stylesheet"
            type="text/css" href="" &gt; )</span>
    </h2>
    <h1><span>ES6 FEATURES IN JAVASCRIPT</span></h1>
    <h3>
        <span>CLASS :</span> I have used class in <span>Program Page</span> as embedded script. I have used it from
            <span>line 151 to 191.</span>"The PromotionManager" class manages
            the program page's promotional information. Its constructor has "promotions," which contains the three
            promotional messages we need to
            display, "element," which picks the HTML element to display these messages, and "intervalId," which is a
            tracking method for the rotation interval.
        <br><br>

        "getRandomPromo" selects messages at random, "displayRandomPromo" changes the webpage's assigned element with a
        randomly selected promotion, and
        "startRotation" cycles through "promotions" at the specified interval (3 seconds) using "setInterval".
        "stopRotation" halts the rotation, allowing
        a message to be displayed. The "displayInitialPromo" method ensures that the message is displayed instantly and
        that the next rotations are triggered
        after the 3-second wait.
    </h3>
    <h3> <span>SET :</span>I have used set in <span>apply.js</span> page which is an external script. I have used it
        from <span>line 170 to 179 and 243.</span>To store
        the major picked, this set was utilized instead of an array. The main motivation for this was to avoid
        duplicates. When an array was first utilized,
        duplicates were placed into the array, causing the "Total Numbers of Major Applied" to be larger than it should
        have been. As a result, a set with no
        duplicate values was used.
    </h3>
    <h3><span>CONST :</span>I have used it in <span>Visit Page</span> as an embedded script. I have used it in
        <span>line 89 to 92 and 123.</span>All the variables declared here are for selectors so, they will not need to
        be changed which will be convenient as “constant” variables cannot be reassigned.
    </h3>
    <h3><span>LET :</span>I have used it in <span>Visit page</span> as an embedded script. I have used it in <span>line
            147 to 150.</span>Let has been used inside an event listener function. As these variables are only going to
        be used inside the function or block, having a block scope (which let has) allows us to only have those
        variables be usable inside the function.
